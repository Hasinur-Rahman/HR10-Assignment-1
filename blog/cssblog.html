        <h3>CSS = Cascading Styling Sheet</h3>
        <p>CSS, or Cascading Style Sheets, is the language used to control the presentation and layout of web pages. It works in conjunction with HTML by defining the visual aspects of a website, such as colors, fonts, spacing, and positioning. CSS enables developers to create visually appealing and responsive designs that adapt to different screen sizes and devices. It allows for the separation of content and design, making it easier to maintain and update web pages. With CSS, designers can ensure consistency across multiple pages of a website, enhancing user experience and accessibility. Mastering CSS is essential for creating polished, professional websites with modern, dynamic layouts.</p>
