        <h3>HTML = Hyper Text Markup Language</h3>
        <p>HTML, or Hypertext Markup Language, is the standard language used to create and structure content on the web. It defines the basic structure of web pages by organizing text, images, links, and other multimedia elements into a readable and interactive format for browsers. HTML provides the foundational layout for websites and is essential for ensuring that web content is correctly displayed. Over the years, it has evolved, with the latest version, HTML5, introducing many new features that improve the usability, accessibility, and efficiency of web design. Learning HTML is often the first step in web development, as it enables the creation of the visual structure and layout of any website.</p>
