        <h3>JavaScript</h3>
        <p>JavaScript is a powerful programming language that enables interactivity and dynamic behavior on web pages. Unlike HTML and CSS, which define structure and style, JavaScript allows websites to respond to user actions, process data, and update content without reloading the page. It is widely used for tasks like form validation, animations, and handling multimedia. As a core technology of the web, JavaScript works across all browsers and platforms, making it a versatile tool for front-end and back-end development. Its flexibility and extensive library support enable developers to create engaging, interactive experiences that enhance user engagement and functionality.</p>
